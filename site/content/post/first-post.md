  think the extra sleep was needed. Luckily there were loads of breakfast

Today i went to the starfield COEX mall, one of seouls biggest malls located in the center of the city. There were numerous food courts, clothes stores and cosmetic stores. It was incredibly overwhelming! But it was amazing to see all of the food, brands, skincare, and other products that i havent seen anywhere else.
